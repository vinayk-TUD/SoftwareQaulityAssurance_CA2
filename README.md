### Scrum sprint backlog and Task Estimaton 

When undertaking new software projects, it is essential to list or outline tasks, goals and features in order accurately predict or measure the time effort and manpower required to complete these goals or objectives. 

In agile development workflow a sprint backlog is developed when your team estimates all tasks that are associated with user stories in quantification of time and effort. The sprint backlog is essentially a list of items teams should complete in a sprint. The practice of creating the sprint backlog results in a shared team perspective, resulting in a task estimation process that is consistent and reliable throughout all sprints. 
it is an essential part of any Agile project during planningso that the team breaks the tasks down into steps 

##### Creating an effective sprint backlog
An effective sprint backlog process must: 
* Contain all tasks and user stories to be addressed during the sprint 
* Have realistic evaluations made by all team members to accurately predict a pace
* Have shared decisions with all team members taking part to diversify perspectives 
* allow for team members to assign tasks to one another, collaborate and promote   communication
